## Introduction
The **Number Guessing Game** provides a **smart and interactive experience** beyond simple guessing. Players can **select a difficulty level**, **receive immediate hints** to guide them, and benefit from **strong input validation** that prevents invalid or illogical entries. **Past guesses and hints are tracked** to help players make informed decisions without losing unnecessary chances. With features like **sound control**, **theme switching**, and **persistent difficulty memory** across sessions, the game ensures a **seamless and personalized gameplay**. Fully responsive with **Bootstrap**, it adapts to all screen sizes for an optimal user experience.

## Features
- **Difficulty Selection**: Choose your difficulty before starting. Each level sets a different number of available chances, which is displayed immediately after selection.
- **Smart Input Validation**: Only valid numbers are accepted. Inputs outside the range (like negatives, numbers above the maximum, decimals, letters, symbols, or empty input) are all blocked with instant feedback — no chances are wasted.
- **Duplicate and Illogical Guess Protection**: Prevents entering the same guess twice or making guesses outside the logical range based on previous hints (e.g., guessing higher than a previous "lower" hint). No chances are deducted, and the correct guessing range is clearly updated.
- **Sound Effects with Instant Control**: Sound effects are triggered on guesses, and sound can be toggled on/off instantly — even mid-sound.
- **Persistent Difficulty Setting**: After playing once, the selected difficulty remains saved even when starting a new game. However, you can always change it anytime before guessing.
- **Theme Toggle (Light/Dark Mode)**: Seamlessly switch between Light and Dark themes for optimal visibility during gameplay.
- **Game Reset Anytime**: Click "New Game" to reset the game instantly. The previously selected difficulty remains unless you manually select a different one.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the game is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
